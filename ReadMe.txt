Star Dog
Made by Spencer Richardson, Chris Pollock, & Riley Strickland
=============================================================

Controls:
=========
WS					Forward and backwards movement
AD					Rotate left and right 
SPACE				Shoot bullet / Respawn if dead

Bird's Eye View		Switches to this when dead
					(Controllable camera. Click and drag to look around. WASD to move.)


Building and Running:
=====================
Run in Release x64 for best results. 
	(Debug x64 also works)


Both the Client(Degenerate) and the Server require Protocol to be built first.
	(Should be the default in Visual Studio, but just in case)


Make sure to run the Server first, then add Clients as desired.
